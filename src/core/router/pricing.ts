 * What a request will cost, before it is sent — the figure the spending caps are checked against.

 * prefix included, and an answer a quarter the size of the question is assumed on top. On a premium
 * model those two together come to roughly $34 per million prompt tokens, which is what makes the
 * caps in `hiveyCode.budget` far tighter than their figures suggest — a cap of $0.25 is reached at
 * about seven thousand tokens, less than agent mode assembles before the question is even added.
 *
 * It lives here rather than beside the caller because a formula that decides whether the product
 * answers at all has to be reachable by a test that does not need VS Code to run.
