// A conversation, and the one idea that makes it controllable: THE TRANSCRIPT IS NOT THE PROMPT.
//
// Every assistant that grew out of a chat window sends the whole history on every turn, and the
// user's only lever is "new conversation". That is expensive (the history is re-billed each turn)
// and imprecise (one bad answer keeps poisoning the next ten). Here the transcript is a log the
// user owns, and what the model sees is DERIVED from it on every turn:
//
//   • drop      — the exchange leaves the transcript for good;
//   • exclude   — the exchange stays visible to the user and stops being sent to the model. This
//                 is the sidebar behaviour we keep: a wrong answer can be muted without losing
//                 the trail of what was tried;
//   • pin       — the exchange survives context trimming when the budget gets tight.
//
// Excluding is not cosmetic: it is the cheapest and most direct control anyone has over both the
// quality and the price of the next turn.
